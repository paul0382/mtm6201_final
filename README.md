## Reflection

Luckily, for my UX/UI project I chose a simpler design believing that websites can be overwhelming and that I would rather click around more than feel overstimulated by a busy homepage. 

Given this, I recreated the homepage that I designed in that class. This was so much more efficient to do using Bootstrap framework than any other CSS coding we've done.  

I came across an issue with the pictures where I understand that I'm supposed to upload multiple sizes. However, the Bootstrap framework that I used offered the best sizing and response. I tried to upload different sizes and implement the <picture> element but it made the website less responsive and clunkier looking. 

I've learned that coding is tedious and that it takes someone passionate to want to work out all of the little quirks necessary to have a perfect website. With that said, I do get excited when I see it come together and can imagine the satisfaction that can be acheived when sharing your end product with a client.
